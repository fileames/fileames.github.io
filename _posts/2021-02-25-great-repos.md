## Just the Docs by pmarsceill
[Github Repository](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs){:target="_blank"}  

While searching for Jekyll themes for this blog, I came across this theme which is basically for documentation purposes. The theme is minimal and contains everything required to create a readable page. I did not need it before but if I ever decide to create a documentation for a project, I will definitely give this theme a try.

## Google Font Previewer Chrome Extension by pamelafox
[Github Repository](https://github.com/pamelafox/font-previewer-extension){:target="_blank"}  

This is a repo for a chrome extension. Deciding on fonts is really hard when you have a lot of options and I was looking for a solution to try them without changing the code every time, then I found the extension. You give a CSS selector and can change the font easily. I used this extension to try the fonts for this blog's header and it was a great help.

## Sarathi Discord Bot by stonecharioteer
[Github Repository](https://github.com/stonecharioteer/sarathi){:target="_blank"}   

stonecharioteer's <a href="https://stonecharioteer.com/til.html" target="_blank">"Today I Learned"</a> blog post was my main inspiration to create this blog and I wanted to include the Discord bot behind it. He created a bot to save the resources he discovered that day automatically to the blog post. I always loved the simple automation created to solve everyday problems and this is a great example. Thanks to this repo, one of my next projects will be to create a personal bot.
