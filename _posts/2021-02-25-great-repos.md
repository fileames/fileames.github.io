There are incredible Github repositories created by great developers and I always want to explore more. With great ideas behind, I see people implementing and using languages different ways so everytime I see that kind of repo, I feel inspired to create more open source content and work on more projects.
I want to make a blog series on the repos I really like and share them once in a while. This post is the hopefully first of many. So here are the repos I discovered recently and really like:

## <a href="https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs" target="_blank">Just the Docs</a> by pmarsceill

While searching for Jekyll themes for this blog, I came across this theme which is basically for documentation purposes. Theme is minimal and contains everything required to create a readable page. I did not need it before but if I ever decide to create a documentation for a project, I will definitely give this theme a try.

## <a href="https://github.com/pamelafox/font-previewer-extension" target="_blank">Google Font Previewer Chrome Extension</a> by pamelafox

This is a repo for a chrome extension. Deciding on fonts is really hard when you have a lot of options and I was looking for a solution to try them without changing the code everytime, then I found the extension. You give a CSS selector and can change the font easily. I used this extension to try the fonts for this blogs header and it was a great help.

## <a href="https://github.com/stonecharioteer/sarathi" target="_blank">Sarathi Discord Bot</a> by stonecharioteer

stonecharioteer's <a href="https://stonecharioteer.com/til.html" target="_blank">"Today I Learned"</a> blog post was my main inspiration to create this blog and I wanted to include the Discord bot behind it. He created a bot to save the resources he discovered that day automatically to the blog post. I always loved the simple automations created to solve everyday problems and this is a great example. Thanks to this repo, one of my next projects will be to create a personal bot.
